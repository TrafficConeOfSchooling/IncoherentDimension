# Incoherent Dimension 
Now with more detailed texture normal maps!

This is a collection of seamless 2k textures (2048x2048) specifically for Supreme Commander map makers. There is no coherent biome here. Includes albedo textures and a normal map for each albedo texture, and a small collection of normal and albedo decals. Licensed under CC0.
