# Incoherent Dimension
Textures dedicated to the purpose of creating Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance maps. 
This is a collection of seamless 2k textures (2048x2048) specifically for Supreme Commander map makers. There is no coherent biome here. Includes albedo textures and a purple normal map for each albedo texture, and a small collection of normal and albedo decals.
